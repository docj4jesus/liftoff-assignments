## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Startland is a local company that assists startups here in Kansas City.

With our app, students will be able to create a unique individual profile, login to the program, complete modules, submit completed work and comment on other students' work as well. We aim for an optimal user experience where all necessary material is available and labeled clearly on the site directly, and students will be able to see their progress as they complete the course. The second focus of the app is to have easy admin access where Startland can quickly update content, post announcements and view student progress and deadlines.
